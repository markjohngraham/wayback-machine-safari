TO INSTALL:

1. Open Safari:
- If 'Develop' menu not visible: Preferences > Advanced tab > Show Develop menu in menu bar (check)
- Develop > Allow Unsigned Extensions (check)
- Don't Quit Safari yet...

2. Move "Wayback Machine.app" to final location before running.
* Recommended to move it into the main Applications folder!
- Double-click to run the app.

3. Alert may popup saying it can't be opened (thanks Catalina!)
- If so, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Open Anyway button

4. Wayback Machine app will now open
- Tap "Show Preferences"
- check Wayback Machine

The extension should have full permissions, but sometimes it doesn't.
If not, you may have to delete it and start over from the ZIP file.

Every time you restart Safari, will need to recheck 'Allow Unsigned Extensions' under Develop menu.

For the Auth Login popup to include check to save password, need to be out of privacy browsing mode.
